{\em Team Lead and Senior Staff Software Engineer }{\em June 2023 to Present}
{
     {\em (C++, C, Python) } \\
     I work on the Open Source TT-Metallium Stack at all levels. At the runtime level I created direct sharded reads and writes allowing users to write a tensor onto the distributed plane of L1 memory across many cores. I also lead the team responsible for data movement operations (e.g Slice, Sharding, Pad, etc.).

\multicell{\bf Groq}{Toronto, Ontario, Canada}
{\em Compiler Engineer }{\em December, 2021 - June 2023}
{
     {\em (C++, C, LLVM, MLIR, Python) } \\
     I worked on implementing a tensor level partitioning analysis. With the tensor level partitioning our support for large graphs has increased to support networks such as Llama.

{\em Machine Learning Intern }{\em August, 2017 - December, 2017}
{
     {\em (Verilog, C++, C, Vivado HLS, Python, TensorFlow, Caffe) } \\
        I designed, synthesized, and emulated,  machine learning cores for high throughput, low-latency applications. I also worked on integrating these cores into popular software frameworks to make these cores accessible to software developers.
