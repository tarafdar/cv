{\em Visiting Scholar }{\em July, 2018}
{
     {\em (Verilog, C++, C, Vivado HLS, Python) } \\
     I worked on integrating an optimized Xilinx Machine Learning Engine into my PhD research of a multi-FPGA and CPU framework.

{\em Machine Learning Intern }{\em August, 2017 - December, 2017}
{
     {\em (Verilog, C++, C, Vivado HLS, Python, TensorFlow, Caffe) } \\
        I designed, synthesized, and emulated,  machine learning cores for high throughput, low-latency applications. I also worked on integrating these cores into popular software frameworks to make these cores accessible to software developers.
