Second Year Undergraduate Course
%    Mentored several groups of 3 students on a long-term software project. I assisted in the evaluation of these students and also provided students guidance with building good software practices along with communication skills. I logged progress of students and helped them manage both with technical skills along with soft management skills such as building trust in a team.

{
Graduate Course
%    Created assignments to introduce students to large System-on-Chip FPGA design as well as High-Level Synthesis. Along with creating the assignments I also built an FPGA framework for students to test their circuits. My framework abstracted away FPGA details such as the I/O such that the students only had to focus on the core. I provided the students a driver and work-flow to incorporate their design in my abstract FPGA.
