\twocol{\bf Galapagos}{\it Custom License}
{
  A full hardware stack for creating and deploying multi-FPGA and CPU applications.
  The stack allows users with different levels of proficiency target multi-FPGA and CPU applications at scale quickly.
  The stack also is flexible and can be adapted to target different network architectures and protocols. 
\\  Available: \textit{https://github.com/tarafdar/galapagos}
}

\twocol{\bf HUMBoldt}{\it Custom License}
{
 A communication layer between multi-CPUs and FPGAs implemented using a subset of MPI. MPI cores built in hardware as Vivado HLS libraries are used to communicate using the network stack provided by the Galapagos project. 
 This allows users to communicate amongst kernels implemented in CPUs and FPGAs by standardizing a protocol. 
\\ Available: \textit{https://github.com/eskandarinariman/HMPI}
}

\twocol{\bf CLMonte}{\it MIT License}
{
    OpenCL implementation of photon simulation using Monte Carlo method.
    This is used for applications like photodynamic cancer therapy.
    We implemented this on GPUs, CPUs and FPGAs for acceleration to get a high quality result quickly. 
\\    Available: \textit{https://github.com/tarafdar/CLMonte}
